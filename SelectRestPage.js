// Page that displays restaurant information and allows users to
// say 'yes' or 'no' to them. To ensure that we are updating the correct
// user preferences, we need to pass in the group_code and the current member
// for that group_code. For each 'user' object, we'll keep 2 arrays, one for the
// positive choices and one for the negative choices.

// To display informaion, we are going to use the Yelp API to query restaurants
// from the radius the 'group_leader' set and then format that information.
